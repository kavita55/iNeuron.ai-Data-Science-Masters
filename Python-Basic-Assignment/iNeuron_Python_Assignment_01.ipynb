    "Variable can be defined as an identifier which stores a value in a specific memory location and can be manipulated later it if needed. Simply, you can say that, variable is used to store a information.<br>\n",
    "e.g.<br>\n",
    "\tvar = 15 <br>\n",
    "So, in the above example, we can say that var are variable that stores the value 15. In Python, there is no specific command to declare a variable. Therefore, to a variable you first assign a value to it in your program. Thus, in the above program, the variable var is created when you assign the value 15 to it, meaning that a memory address is allocated to store the value 15. Later, when you re-assign using var = 10, the value in the corresponding memory address will be changed to 10. A variable can be of several types like integer, string, float, complex etc. based on the value you assign to it.<br>\n",
