We can set up the in-place addition behavior for our own class by overriding the magic “dunder” method __iadd__(self, other) in our class definition."

    "\n",
    "Answer: The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class. Hence when we have to extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning we can use operator overloading,"
